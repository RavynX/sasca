  <p>San Antonio Sports Car Association</p>
  <p>2004 Autocross Rules</p>

  <ol>
    <li>General Information and Definitions</li>
      <ol>
        <li>
   
        A. The Board of Directors (BOD) is made up of SASCA's elected
           officers and its immediate past President. If the immediate
           past President is an officer, the officers may elect a fifth
           BOD member.
   
        B. The BOD appoints various Chairs to handle specific operations.  In
           addition to Autocross and Safety (required), Equipment, Membership,
           Publicity, Registration, Timing, and Technical Inspection Chairs
           are typically appointed. The BOD also appoints the Tale Lites Editor.
   
        C. Unless otherwise stated below, autocross events are governed by the
           Sports Car Club of America's (SCCA) SOLO I & II RULES.  Since the new
           rulebook is not available on 1 January, the old rules are used until
           it is available.  The Autocross Chair ensures that copies of the
           current rules and this document are available at events.
   
        D. SCCA rules may be modified by statements in the FASTRACK section of
           SPORTS CAR magazine. A driver is responsible for providing the
           appropriate FASTRACK if necessary to resolve disputes.
   
  II.  Autocross and Safety Chairs
   
        A. These Chairs are responsible for ensuring that courses are
           appropriate and safe.  If they can't attend an event, the BOD
           names temporary Chairs.
   
        B. Eventmasters must review their courses with either Chair before
           setting up the course.
   
        C. The Chairs may change a course at any time if driver or vehicle
           safety is compromised.  If they do so, drivers who have completed
           any runs get reruns.  With the concurrence of the BOD members
           present, they may suspend or terminate an event if factors other
           than the course (e.g., weather) compromise driver safety.
   
        D. Anyone at an event may bring a safety issue to the Chairs' attention.
   
  III.  Fees
   
        A. Membership dues will be $25 per year.
   
        B. The autocross fee for SASCA members is $20.00.
   
        C. The autocross fee for students and active duty or retired
           armed services members is $23.00.  A current identification
           card is required.
   
        D. The autocross fee for all others is $25.00.
   
        E. Autocross fees may be changed for special events.
   
        F. Members holding a SASCA Chairman position receive free club
           membership during their active tenure.
   
        G. An addition event fee of $5 will be levied during the
           late registration period.
   
  IV.  Schedule
   
        Generally, no registration will be allowed after the close of late
        registration. The President or his representative may consider allowing
        a driver late registration under dire circumstances. The BOD may
        modify the default schedule below if events warrent a change.
   
        Registration            0730 - 0830
        Late Registration       0830 - 0900
        Tech Inspection         0730 - 0915
        Drivers' meeting               0945
        First car out                  1015
   
  V.  Driver Restrictions
   
        A. Drivers may double enter an event but only one entry will
           have standings count for end-of-year Class or Pax trophies.  The
           number of drivers allowed to double enter may be restricted on a
           first come first served basis.
   
        B. The Eventmaster, Autocross Chair, or Safety Chair may drive the
           course before an event to estimate the course time or evaluate
           course safety.  If they are competing, the car used must be other
           than the one used in competition.
   
        C. Drivers who do not promptly report to the Eventmaster for work
           when required will not be allowed to take any further runs. 
           Additionally, any runs taken prior to that time will be changed to
           DNS (did not show) and their names will be stricken from all results.
           The BOD may blacklist a driver from future SASCA events for a
           pattern of failures to report for worker duty.
   
  VI.   Bumping
   
        Bumping (SCCA Rules) is not required.  A driver in a single car class
        may bump to make a two car class.
   
  VII.  Event Trophies
   
        The winner of each events "Novice" class will receive a trophy and one
        free autocross.
   
  VIII. Annual Car Numbers and Technical Inspections
   
        A.  SASCA members may apply for a number to use for the calendar year
            by requesting one during registration.  A member of Technical
            Inspection team will the show them how to inspect their car.
   
        B.  Members with annual numbers may conduct their own technical
            inspection at any event during the  year by filling out and
            signing the inspection check list on their entry form.
   
        C.  Drivers without annual numbers must have their cars inspected
            by the inspection team.
   
        D.  The Registration Chair may release an annual number to another
            driver when it becomes apparent that the driver assigned the
            number will not compete at an event.
   
  IX.  Run Order
   
        A.  Cars are divided into two or three approximately equal sized groups.
            Each group makes Â½ of the expected total number of runs until all
            cars complete a set of runs. Any additional sets follow in the same
            order. The Eventmaster may change the order prior to the day of the
            event with the concurrence of the BOD.
   
        B.  At the Eventmaster's discretion, a driver may be granted permission
            to run out of order.
   
  X.  Protests
   
        A.  Any driver may make Protests.  They are limited to the conduct
            of the event, the classification of a car in the protestant's
            class, or the Novice status of a driver if they are entered
            in Novice.
   
        B.  Protests must be discussed with the Eventmaster within 15 minutes
            of the alleged infraction in procedure or the first run of the
            allegedly misclassified car or driver.  If the matter is not
            resolved, a formal protest may be filed with the Eventmaster.
   
        C.  When a formal procedural protest is presented to the Eventmaster,
            the Eventmaster interrupts the event until the matter is resolved. 
            If a procedural protest is valid, the Eventmaster corrects the
            procedure and arranges reruns for drivers who were prejudiced by
            the inappropriate procedure.
   
        D.  Formal protests of car or driver classification must be filed
            within 15 minutes after the end of the discussion with the
            Eventmaster.  They must be presented to the Eventmaster in
            writing and accompanied by a $20.00 protest fee.  The Eventmaster
            then appoints a committee of five to review the protest.  Membership
            typically includes the Autocross, Safety, and Technical Inspection
            Chairs, a member of the BOD, and another SASCA member.  However, no
            one may be on the committee if its decision affects their status
            at the event or their end of the year point standings.
   
            The committee may not require disassembly of a protested car.  It
            may require that compartments be opened (engine compartment or
            any with access covers), that wheels be removed from the car,
            and that the car be jacked up to allow inspection of the
            undercarriage.
   
            If a protest of a car or a driver's Novice status is upheld, the
            Novice or the car driver(s) is disqualified without returning their
            entry fee(s).  The protestor's fee is returned.  If the protest is
            disallowed, the protestor's fee is not returned.
   
  XI.  Optional Classes
   
        A driver may elect to enter only one of the following three classes.
   
        A.  Novice Class is for drivers who have not placed first though third
            at any Solo II or autocross type motor sports event.  Class standings
            are based on the PAX times generated from the original SCCA class. 
            Novices ranking first in their class on two occasions are no longer
            eligible for the class. R compound tires are not allowed in Novice
            class.
   
        B. Street Tire is comprised of cars using DOT tires with a wear ratings
           of 150 and greater.  Class standings are based on the PAX times
           generated from the original SCCA class.
   
  XII.  Class Championships
   
        A.  SASCA awards trophies to members with the most points in their SCCA
            or Street Modified class during the year.  A member must compete
            in at least two thirds (2/3s) of that years SASCA autocross events to
            be eligible for a trophy.
   
        B.  Points for each event are based on the member's ranking within a
            class.  First place is awarded six points; second, four; third,
            three; fourth, two ; and fifth, one.
   
        C.  Comparing the number of relative standings (1st places, 2nd places,
            etc.) breaks ties.  If a tie persists, two trophies are awarded.
   
  XIII.  PAX Championship
   
        A.  SASCA awards trophies to the five entrants with the highest
            total PAX points accumulated over the year.  Only those competing
            in eight events are eligible for the trophies.
   
        B.  50 PAX points is awarded to the fastest PAX time at an autocross
            event.  2nd fastest gets 49 points.  Each "next fastest" driver gets
            1 point less.  All drivers get a minumum of 1 PAX point if they
            complete the event.
   
        C.  Comparing the number of relative standings (1st places, 2nd places,
            etc.) breaks ties.  If a tie persists, two trophies are awarded.
   
  XIV.  Driver of the Year
   
        A.  The BOD may award a trophy to a member who has demonstrated unusual
            proficiency or improvement in his or her driving skills during a
            year.  The BOD accepts nominations for the award from any member
            and may generate nominations at any of its meetings.
   
        B.  The BOD votes on nominees after the November event.  The nominee
            with the highest number of votes is awarded the trophy.  Ties are
            broken by a run off between the two candidates with the highest
            number of votes.  If a tie persists, the BOD discusses the candidates
            and votes again until the tie is broken.
   
  XV.  Novice of the Year
   
        A.  The BOD may award a trophy to a member who competes as a Novice
            and has demonstrated unusual improvement during his or her first
            year of autocross competition.  The BOD accepts nominations
            for the award from any member and may generate nominations
            at any of its meetings.
   
        B.  The BOD votes on nominees after the November event.  The nominee
            with the highest number of votes is awarded the trophy.  Ties
            are broken by a run off between the two candidates with the highest
            number of votes.  If a tie persists, the BOD discusses the
            candidates and votes again until the tie is broken.
