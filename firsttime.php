	<p><h1>On Being a Novice</h1></p>
	
	<p>You'll remember your first event for a long time. The adrenaline that makes you shake at the start-line before your first run, and the even bigger surge of adrenaline you feel when you finish. That excitement is part of the sport, and it's why we all do this.</p>

	<p>Don't let being a novice overwhelm you! Every driver, including the National Champions, had a first day and a novice season. Autocrossing is a skill that requires instruction and practice to see improvements. If it was easy, it wouldn't be so competitive, or so fun. In fact, when experienced road racers come to Solo for the first time, we often put them in Novice Class. It's not like falling off a log for them, either. The great thing about this sport, though, is that even when you're going "slow", it's still fun driving.</p>

	<p>The course may seem "busy" at first, because it's tighter than what you see on the street, and you're trying to attack it faster than you could in traffic. You'll have fun learning the sport and learning to keep the car in control as you get faster and better with more seat-time.</p>

	<p>With that said, here are some tips to give you the right novice attitude, so you don't become discouraged:</p>

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Your goal is to have fun! That's why everyone is here.</li>
			<li>Your goal for the first run is to avoid getting lost on course (see course-walking tips)</li>
			<li>Your goal for the rest of the day is to improve your time on each run</li>
			<li>Your goal for the second event is the same as the first.</li>
			<li>Your goal for the rest of the season is to beat somebody (anybody!) and continue to make each run faster than the last.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>At this point, you are learning a lot on each run, and you may be 10 seconds behind the class leader. That's not unusual! You're still doing OK.</p>

	<p>Generally speaking, the veteran drivers like to help the novices. The magic words "I am a novice" will get you extra instruction from other competitors, who can critique your run. Just be careful not to interrupt a driver on a course walk, or while he or she is concentrating on going over the course in his or her head. (See the section on Solo Etiquette.)</p>

	<p>Don't forget, there is a Novice Class Instructor available to answer your questions and help you get started.</p>

	<p><h1>Solo Etiquette</h1></p>

	<p>Solo II is a social sport, and most drivers are happy to give you advice and critique your runs. Ask someone with a similar car if you may follow them through a course walk. Maybe they'll even think aloud for you (don't do too much talking yourself, or you will be making them walk again). Ask if you can ride with them on a fun-run, and offer to pay the $1-$2 for the run. If you're not sure when to line up, go ahead and ask. Ask someone to look at the chalk on your tires to see whether you need more air. Ask someone to watch your run if they have time, and tell you what needs changing. They'll be glad to.</p>

	<p>There are a few bad times to ask for advice, though. Here's a quick list:

	<p>When they are walking the course. (They're trying to memorize it.)

	<p>When they are staring into space or have their eyes closed, they're probably going over their run or plan.

	<p>When they are in grid. They are only thinking about the course.

	<p>Sometimes events will conspire to keep a good driver from competiting. It may be a broken car, it may be an injury that prevents them from being able to change tires. This is your chance! Offer that driver a ride (co-drive) in your car - make it free if you can afford to. So they use up $20 worth of tires. Not a bad price for a private instructor all day! I have gone to some of the big events, Tours, Divisionals and ProSolos and sent out an ad for a co-driver. It has been an enourmous benefit to have advice from these experts all day, and be able to walk the course with them.

	<p>Try to help out. There is more work to be done than the mandatory course-work. This is an all-volunteer organization, so help is always appreciated. Luckily, this also puts you in a position to talk to other drivers, because the veterans are helping out, too. If you share the work, they'll have more time to talk to you. Likewise, showing up early will help out the registration and tech crew, and give you more time to walk the course. Read the next section on how to help, if you're looking for ideas to lend a hand.

	<p>Everyone stays to help clean up the course and pit areas. Keeping the sites is important to everyone, so leave your pit area cleaner than you found it.

	<p>The trophy presentation is a continuation of the event, and people talk about the course or their cars or runs. It's nice to have everyone show up, to cheer the winners, even if you didn't get a trophy yourself.

	<p><h1>How to Help Out at an Event</h1></p>

	<p>(You don't have to spend money to help. The region pays for all supplies)</p>

	<p>While you're still a novice:</p>

	<p>Arrive extra early and be a gopher during course set-up.</p>

	<p>Help sweep the course in sandy corners.</p>

	<p>Line the course, or mark the cones.</p>

	<p>Fill and bring water coolers if it might be a hot day</p>

	<p>Help at registration: carry the waiver board through the line, or go through the line with registration cards and a pen. Check that everyone has their license and SCCA card out. Identify novices and give them a novice book.</p>

	<p>Offer to be pre-event gopher. Does someone need to run for lime? Marking pencils, scoreboard cleaner or batteries?</p>

	<p>Get water/lunch/whatever for the event officials stuck in the timing trailer or safety.</p>

	<p>Corral people to help clean up, or take a walk through the pit area to pick up things left behind.</p>

	<p>Offer to stamp and mail the results</p>

	<p>See if the trailer needs supplies between events, then pick them up and bring them along next time.</p>

	<p>When you get more comfortable with the way things run:</p></p>

	<p>Help the event chair in calculating results and preparing trophies</p>

	<p>Learn how to tech cars</p>

	<p>Learn timing and scoring.</p>

	<p>Be a novice helper. You can go over course-work with the novices while the novice chief takes his or her course walks.</p>

	<p>Learn how to set up timing</p>

	<p>Get your safety steward's license.</p>

	<p>Get involved! It's fun to be a part of the action.</p>
