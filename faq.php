	<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1><br/>

	<p class="ques">What payment types are accepted?</p>
	<p class="ans">SASCA accepts Cash, Checks, Debit, and Credit Cards. Please also have your driver's license ready during check-in.</p>

	<p class="ques">Do I have to register online?</p>
	<p class="ans">No, you may register on-site the day of the event but it's easier on both you and us if you preregister online to streamline your time through check-in at the trailer in the morning.</p>

	<p class="ques">Do I pay online or at the event?</p>
	<p class="ans">Whether you register online or on-site, you will pay when you check in at the trailer on event day.</p>

	<p class="ques">How long do I have to preregister online?</p>
	<p class="ans">You have until midnight two nights before the event to preregister online.  If the event is Saturday then you have until Thursday evening.</p>

	<p class="ques">What if I'm preregistered and I have to change a numer/class/car/etc on event day?</p>
	<p class="ans">You may change what you need to on event day during the check-in process at the trailer.  Just go to the non-preregistered side of the trailer (the side with the computer) in order to change details on your registration.</p>

	<p class="ques">How do I register for the 'Double' PAX class?</p>
	<p class="ans">Doubles are no longer pre-register option.  We are currently limiting the Double class to the first 15 drivers who sign up at the event. Please see our <a href="doubles.php">Doubles Page</a> for more information.</p>
