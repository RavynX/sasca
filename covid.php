        <p>Q: Do event participants have to wear a mask at the event?</p>
        <p>A: If you read to the end of this page, there are references at the bottom. You will find a link to the Governor's Open Texas Page that provides the following guidance for Outdoor Motorsports: </p>
        <p class="italic">"Maintain at least 6 feet of separation from other individuals not within the same household. If such distancing is not feasible, other measures such as hand hygiene, cough etiquette, cleanliness, and sanitation should be rigorously practiced. Face shields may be considered as additional source control either in addition to face coverings, or where face coverings are not feasible. Considerations must be made regarding safety of face coverings during physical exertion or in hot environments.”</p>
        <p class="blue">SASCA requires face coverings be worn while in the SASCA trailer, in grid, and while riding in a car with a person who is not in your household.</p>
        <p>SASCA also provides consideration, according to the above, regarding safety of face coverings during physical exertion or in hot environments. Our event venue provides enough open space to allow for 6 ft of social distancing for those not in the SASCA trailer and in grid. The venue will also be in an open parking lot where the weather will be hot. Therefore, we are not requiring face coverings at our events for any situation outside of the above listed situations.</p>
