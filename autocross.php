<h1>What is Autocross?</h1>

<p>Solo is the SCCA brand name for autocross competition. Autocross events are driving skill contests that emphasize the driver's ability and the car's handling characteristics. This is accomplished by driving a course that is designated by traffic cones on a low hazard location, such as a parking lot or inactive airstrip. While speeds are no greater than those normally encountered in legal highway driving, the combination of concentration and car feedback creates an adrenaline pumping experience. The runs are timed down to a thousanth of a second.
